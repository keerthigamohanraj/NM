Introduction

Educational administration involves managing student records, course information, and faculty assignments. Traditionally, these processes are handled manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

To overcome these challenges, this project implements a cloud-based educational management system using ServiceNow. The platform ensures:

Secure data handling

Automated workflows

Real-time access and updates

Streamlined communication between departments

Problem Statement

The existing manual system of managing institutional data causes:

Data duplication and inconsistency

Lack of real-time updates

Inefficient reporting and analytics

Increased administrative workload

Security risks with physical or unstructured digital files

Proposed Solution

The proposed system leverages ServiceNow to automate data management and process workflows.

Objectives:

Automate student admission and record management

Implement workflow automation for approvals

Enable automated ID and result generation

Centralize all educational data

Provide real-time performance insights

System Features

Centralized Database: All data stored in one place

Automated ID Generation: Using ServiceNow’s “Get Next Padded Number”

Flow Designer Automation: For admissions, course assignments, and approvals

Custom Forms: User-friendly data entry through Form Designer

Role-Based Access: Secure permissions for Admin, Faculty, and Students

Reporting and Dashboards: Real-time insights and analytics

Architecture

The system follows a three-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer: User interface with forms, lists, and dashboards

Application Layer: Workflows, scripts, and business logic

Database Layer: Custom ServiceNow tables (Students, Courses, Results)

Each layer ensures flexibility, maintainability, and secure data communication.

Methodology

Table Creation: Custom tables for students, faculty, and courses

Form Design: Interactive forms using Form Designer and UI Policies

Number Maintenance: Automated padded ID generation

Flow Creation: Process automation for admission and updates

Client Scripts:

Auto Populate Script

Periodic Update Script

Disable Field Script

Total Marks and Percentage Calculation

Result Evaluation Script

Results

The project successfully:

Eliminates manual record-keeping

Improves transparency and data consistency

Reduces administrative workload

Provides real-time analytics and dashboards

Advantages and Limitations
Advantages
